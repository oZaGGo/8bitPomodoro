# 8bitPomodoro
Simple "pomodoro web" for learning JS and DOM.

I created a simple Pomodoro timer web app with a retro 8-bit style and dynamic backgrounds based on the current time. This was my first project to learn basic JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation. It's a basic implementation made in a hurry, without focusing on responsive design or polishing details. The main goal was to create something visually appealing and functional as a learning exercise.

- My Jouney:

I embarked on a project to create a Pomodoro timer web application with a retro 8-bit aesthetic and dynamic backgrounds that change based on the current time. While the concept seemed straightforward at first, I encountered challenges when implementing the dynamic backgrounds. Initially, I tried other methods to update the CSS, but found that they didn't work without manually refreshing the browser cache with Ctrl+F5. This led me to suspect that the browser was caching the resources.

In my exploration of browser caching mechanisms, I discovered that browsers cache resources like CSS files to improve performance. Armed with this knowledge, I implemented a solution where I appended version numbers (e.g., v2, v3) to the CSS file names to force a cache refresh. Surprisingly, this approach worked, and the dynamic backgrounds updated as expected.

Through this experience, I gained insights into web performance optimization and caching strategies, learning how to work with browser caching mechanisms effectively.

This project was a significant learning experience for me, highlighting the importance of perseverance and problem-solving in web development. It deepened my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation techniques, with guidance from resources like OpenWebinars courses and YouTube tutorials.

Throughout the development process, I also leveraged interactive assistance from AI models like ChatGPT, which provided valuable insights and support.

Ultimately, this project not only served as a learning exercise but also provided a practical tool for personal use. It represents my journey in web development, showcasing my growth from a beginner to a more confident and resourceful developer.
